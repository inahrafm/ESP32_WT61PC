\# Portable Vibration Monitoring Device for Railway Switch Machines (Wesel) â€“ Predictive Maintenance Tool



This portable vibration monitoring device is designed to detect and analyze mechanical vibrations on the \*stang wesel\* (point machine switch rods) in railway systems such as those operated by KAI (Kereta Api Indonesia). The goal is to enable \*\*predictive maintenance\*\* and \*\*early detection of mechanical faults\*\*, reducing the risk of sudden failure and ensuring safer and more reliable railway operations.

\## Features



\- \*\*Real-Time Vibration Data\*\*: Captures acceleration, angular velocity, and tilt angle using a 6-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).

\- \*\*Predictive Maintenance Monitoring\*\*: Vibration signatures are analyzed to identify early signs of wear, looseness, or mechanical failure.

\- \*\*ESP32-Based System\*\*: Handles data acquisition and provides wireless connectivity for remote monitoring or local data logging.

\- \*\*Portable Design\*\*: Compact enough to be attached directly to the point machine's \*stang wesel\* for on-site testing or permanent installation.

\- \*\*Low Power Operation\*\*: Can be battery-powered for mobile inspection or field testing without needing constant external power.

\## Components



\- \*\*ESP32\*\* (microcontroller with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth)

\- \*\*WT61PC IMU Sensor\*\* (for 3-axis acceleration, gyroscope, and angle data)

\- \*\*Lithium battery + charging circuit\*\* (for portable use)

\- \*(Optional: microSD module, WiFi dashboard, or LoRa for remote deployment)\*

\## Benefits



\- Enables \*\*early detection of faults\*\* in point machine components through vibration analysis.

\- Helps maintenance teams perform \*\*data-driven, condition-based maintenance\*\* instead of time-based schedules.

\- Increases \*\*operational safety and reliability\*\* in railway switch systems.

\- Reduces downtime and prevents costly emergency repairs by anticipating mechanical failures.
